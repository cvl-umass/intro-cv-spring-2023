title: Welcome to Intro to CV, Spring 2023!
---

We are excited to welcome you to the Spring 2023 offering of COMPSCI 370 class!

A few organizational moments:
- **Lectures.**
  This year, we will offer an in-class section of the course.
  You can find the links to all materials, including slides and video streams, on lectures and Moodle page.
- **Logistics.**
  Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the class logistics.
- **Homework assignments** will appear on the Moodle page. We will also post a note on Piazza when that happens along with the deadlines. Grading and submission will be done via Gradescope.

We are looking forward to a productive semester working with you!
